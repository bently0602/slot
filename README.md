The RG34XX will likely work from 1.4.0. The RG34XXSP may not map its sticks correctly.

If you have one of the Untested devices, or have tried slot on a device not listed,
please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/issues) and let me know how it went.

# Desktop testing (Ubuntu / WSL)

Run from an Ubuntu or Debian terminal, including Ubuntu in WSL on Windows:

```bash
bash setup-desktop.sh --run
```

The script installs missing system prerequisites (using sudo when needed), installs
the pinned Rust toolchain, builds the desktop app and patched mGBA core, and prepares
`sdcard/`. Omit `--run` to set up without launching. It is safe to rerun: Cargo reuses
its build cache, an up-to-date mGBA core is reused, and existing ROMs, saves, BIOS files
and settings are preserved. Desktop build files are kept separate from device builds.

Put unzipped ROMs in `sdcard/Games/GBA`, `sdcard/Games/GB` or `sdcard/Games/GBC`, and
select mGBA for desktop gameplay. WSL launches need WSLg; the script configures WSL
audio locally without changing your personal ALSA settings.

WSL launches default to X11 with software rendering to avoid Wayland and GPU
driver failures. This uses more CPU than hardware rendering. If your WSL graphics
drivers work, use `bash setup-desktop.sh --run --native-graphics` to keep the normal
display and graphics configuration. Native Linux launches keep their normal graphics.

If a graphics failure left WSLg unresponsive, save your work in WSL, run
`wsl --shutdown` in Windows PowerShell, reopen Ubuntu, and retry the script. Shutdown
stops all running WSL distributions, including WSL sessions used by Docker.

# AI Disclosure

The Rust frontend was put together by Claude Opus. I reviewed everything that was
produced. All documentation is 100% free-range, meatbag prose.

The project is extremely low stakes. I wanted a bespoke frontend for my RG SP and thought
that something that evokes the feeling of using my GBA SP as a kid would be pretty neat.

Use it, don't use it, I don't care.

Figured I should share the end result of all the wasted water. ✌🏻
